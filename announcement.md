First we'd like to thank everyone for being with us. For the past 2.5 years, we've maintained hacks for the math game Prodigy.

Our original goal, which was raising awareness about the security of Prodigy has (mostly) been accomplished!
While we would love to continue maintaining hacks, we collectively have had less and less time to focus on development.
Server costs are also surprisingly expensive..! Who knew?

For these reasons, As of April 10th, 2022, we will shut down our instance of P-NP.
Hacks for the most part will no longer work.

We will keep our source code on GitHub, where anyone can continue development by forking our repositories.
We'll continue to review pull requests, but patched hacks most likely will remain patched.

If you would like to run your own instance of the hacks, we'll soon release instructions on how to run P-NP.
This discord server will move from a Prodigy Hacking server to a Coding focused server over the next month.

Thank you all for understanding, and being with us for the past few years.
So long, and thanks for all the fish.
